      <p> Recent engineering graduate with interests in artificial intelligence, biomedical engineering, computer programming, teaching and magic. I'm a curious and driven person, who enjoys being immersed in difficult problems.
    When I'm not working/teaching I enjoy reading, surfing, hiking and swimming. </p>

        <h3 class="project-title">Final undergraduate project</h3>
        <p>My project was focused on image segmentation for use in training semantic segmentation neural networks, ultimately for use in self-driving cars. I took two approaches. First, a purely heuristic approach (written in Matlab), which leveraged LiDAR data to form hierarchical depth clusters, from which objects of interest could be segmented. This approach was extended to incorporate a GUI. Second, a neural network approach (using Tensorflow) which first identified coarse bounding boxes around objects of interest and then refined the bounding boxes by hierarchical clustering of LiDAR data.<a href="documents/josh_stein_final_year_project.pdf" target="_blank">Click here for a copy of my project.</a></p>

        <h3 class="project-title">Compressive Sensing (CS)</h3>
        <p>As part of my 4th year Digital Signal Processing course I elected to do self-proposed topic in Compressive Sensing (CS) - a means of allowing for sub-Nyquist sampling to effectively be performed. I took a mostly investigative approach, attempting to understand and implement CS. I implemented sub-Nyquist reconstruction in Python and MATLAB.<a href="documents/compressive_sensing.pdf" target="_blank">Click here for a copy of my project.</a></p>

        <h3 class="project-title">Juggling counter</h3>
        <p>I like juggling. I wanted to make a program that counts the number of throws (and by implication catches) for me. Most approaches either use (a) a predefined ball colour (e.g. green) which is then filtered out from the rest of the image for tracking, or (b) a preset number of balls.
        <br><br>
        By using background image subtraction I was able to implement an approach that can count any number of balls of any colour. Sweet :)</p>

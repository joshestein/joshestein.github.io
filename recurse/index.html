      <h2>My time at the Recurse Center</h2>
      <p>
        I spent 12 weeks at RC. I am most proud of the awesome people I met, and
        how I inspired I feel after having worked with them.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>Here is a list of things I worked on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/amymc/dial-a-poem"
            >Hacked a rotary phone</a
          >
          to automatically play chosen poems/jokes based on the number you dial,
          using a raspberry pi. The project was inspired by
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-A-Poem">Dial-A-Poem</a>.

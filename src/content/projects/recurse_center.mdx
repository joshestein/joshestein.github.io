I spent 12 weeks at RC. I am most proud of the awesome people I met, and how I inspired I feel after having worked with
them.

Here is a list of things I worked on:

- [Hacked a rotary phone](https://github.com/amymc/dial-a-poem) to automatically play chosen poems/jokes based on the
  number you dial, using a raspberry pi. The
  project was inspired by [Dial-A-Poem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dial-A-Poem). Demo: https://youtu.be/enE1PwRzfh4
- Implemented and deployed a web-server to handle uploading custom audio and URLs to the rotary phone
- Helped build/refactor an app that uses machine learning to detect illegal parking in NYC and automatically files
  service
  requests with the NYPD
- [Click to ship](https://ship.joshstein.io/)
- Helped implement Q-learning and DQN on a handwritten Mancala game
- Built a [real-time ASL detector](https://github.com/joshestein/sign_language_inference) that runs in the browser
- Helped implement a Rust program that runs a custom shader in WGPU
- Helped create a TooGoodToGo wrapper to display nearby results on the RCTV.
  Repo: https://github.com/joshestein/TooGoodToGo-RecurseTV
- Learned about nix and switched my OSX and dotfiles setup to nix-darwin and home-manager
- Learned about MRIs and created an interactive explorable using ThreeJS, HTML canvas and WebGL
- [Implemented](https://github.com/joshestein/ProtoPNet) [ProtoPNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10574)
- Worked through a bunch of AI safety readings/discussions, finished BlueDot Impact's AI Safety Fundamentals course
- Fixed a problem in Flask-Moment that prevented strings being accepted as valid inputs. Relevant
  PR: https://github.com/miguelgrinberg/Flask-Moment/pull/94
- Spent some time trying to get Quickscope and Sneak to work nicely in
  IdeaVim, [working on a PR to fix the issue](https://github.com/JetBrains/ideavim/pull/882)
- Worked through several chapters of Crafting
  Interpreters, [progress here](https://github.com/joshestein/craftinginterpreters)
- Wrote a [time-blocker app](https://github.com/joshestein/time_blocker) to learn Svelte
- Wrote a CLI tool to (start to) learn Rust
- Helped a friend making a real landline phone ring when you call via a raspberry pi
- Helped a friend design and build the initial circuitry for
  an [interactive wearable glove](https://elijer.github.io/garden/Projects/Gauntlet)
- Implemented Pong on the [Rapid Riter](https://github.com/gregsadetsky/rapidriteros), an LED matrix in the hub
- Upgraded and re-organised the community cluster
- Fixed the <a href={thunderTube.src} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thundertube</a>, a home-made LED strip within the space
- Gave a non-programming talk on Hexaflexagons and Martin Gardner

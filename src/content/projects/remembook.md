I (try to) read a lot. I forget most of what I read. I wanted to create
something to help me remember more.

I wanted to focus on books (not articles, online content, etc.). For a long
time, I wanted to create custom quizzes for these books. The problem is
creating these quizzes takes _a lot_ of time and diligence. Of course, if you
do this, it also helps with your memory retention. More than 2 years ago I
thought of having a MCQ-type interface that I could interact with while
pooping. Think of Anki flashcards, but with really challenging questions based
on the content of each book.

Considering AI has read every book, it became a natural extension to ask an LLM
to create these quiz questions.

This is the first paid product I'm launching!

As part of my 4th year Digital Signal Processing course I elected to do self-proposed topic in Compressive Sensing (
CS) - a means of allowing for sub-Nyquist sampling to effectively be performed. I took a mostly investigative approach,
attempting to understand and implement CS. I implemented sub-Nyquist reconstruction in Python and
MATLAB. [Click here for

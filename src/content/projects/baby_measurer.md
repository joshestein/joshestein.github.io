For my Project Management and Software Development for Medical Applications (PMSD) course I developed a low-cost mobile
application to measure infant height and weight. I used Flutter/Dart, SQLite, TensorFlow Lite and OpenCV. The core of my
solution is to use playing cards as relative reference to determine the true height of a baby. [You can read more about
my project and view the code on GitHub.](https://github.com/joshestein/PMSD)

I gained extensive experience working with a small team contributing to a platform dedicated to aggregating and
interpreting all data points across the fresh produce supply chain. Working in a small team was fulfilling, and allowed
me to make significant contributions to improve the platform and user experience. I enjoyed being given autonomy in my
work and working closely with more experienced developers. Specific technologies used: Ruby on Rails, Angular, Heroku,
Postgres and GitLab.

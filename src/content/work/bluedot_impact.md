I recently started a new role at BlueDot impact; I am excited to be able to
contribute to work I believe is very important. After years of interest in AI
safety, I now have the opportunity to really dedicate myself to a part of the
problem. The team is dynamic and smart, and I am looking forward to being able
to learn and grow from their expertise.

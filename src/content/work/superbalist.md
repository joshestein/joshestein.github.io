Interned for 4 weeks, working with the Growth team. We were responsible for attracting new customers to the platform and
achieving higher conversion rates of existing customers. I worked on an internal web app that allowed for
hyper-targeting of users. Worked on front-end and back-end aspects of the project, using a combination of Python (
Django), HTML, Javascript and Zephyr.

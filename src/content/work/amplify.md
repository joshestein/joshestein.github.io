Mathigon (acquired by Amplify Education) is an edtech startup dedicated to making maths more interactive, playful and
fun. My work has focused on building interactive tools for the Polypad, an interactive whiteboard used by millions of
users a month. I have thoroughly enjoyed my work, and being able to contribute to values I align with so strongly.
Mathigon is making a significant impact on the landscape of digital education, shaping the way teachers can make maths
more fun and engaging. My biggest contribution has been implementing the real-time collaboration system.

Volunteer teacher of magic, illusions, performance theory and showmanship. I have taught students aged 9-17. Finding
myself in multiple positions of mentor-ship, I have tried my best to nurture and guide students, cultivating their love
for magic and their skills as performers. Responsibilities have included managing multiple curricula, creating and
running lessons, training students, assisting teachers, performing magic and managing events.

Sometimes you are enjoying a book so much that you don't want to finish.

You are so engulfed by the story, the world and characters that you can sense
the impending loss for when you will finally be done. There is a tension: you
want to finish and know what happens but at the same time, you can't bring
yourself to finish because you are enjoying it too much.

I think there should be a word for this... something to do with paralysis of
expectation or anticipation?

Yimalysis? From Xhosa 'yima' and 'paralysis'?

I was recently fortunate enough to visit the Netherlands and I found myself
truly awestruck at the quality of life that people there live.

From the outside, it seems like they have no problems; of course, this is
naive, and every country has problems.

But looking at basic needs being met, and reliable social services, and great
work-life balance, I couldn't help but think about how comfortable people there
seem.

On the one hand, I have a lot of admiration for this. On the other, I worry
about getting _too_ comfortable.

The most meaningful things I've worked on have come with suffering. The things
I get great joy from - hiking, climbing, surfing - all involve a level of
suffering that make them rewarding for me.

I might be masochistic, but I truly believe that suffering heightens your
experiences, in a positive way. Don't quote me out of context - I'm of course
not advocating for unnecessary suffering. I wouldn't want to inflict pain on
people just so they know what it is to suffer! But there is an inevitability of
unwanted pain that we all experience.

But there is a ton of _necessary_ suffering we face; the first noble truth
after all: life is suffering. And throughout all this necessary suffering,
there is great opportunity to grow and learn. But more than this, I think it
makes your life meaningful and worthwhile.

Suffering to me means that you believe in something enough to work through pain
for it. It means you're willing to accept tough times, even knowing that you
could be pursuing an easier route. It means doing the hard thing.

Living a life where your main goal is to never be uncomfortable is unrealistic.
But it also means you will never do anything meaningful, or work on something
truly difficult.

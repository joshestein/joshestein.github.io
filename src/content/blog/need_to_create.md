I think one of the things that makes us uniquely human is our desire to create.

Like writing, I believe creating is a form of thinking.

When you create, you give yourself permission to imagine and play. You force yourself into making false assumptions
and thinking false thoughts. There is no wrong or right, only the desire to see something realised, and the act of that
realisation.

Many people, myself included, feel that we are not creative enough. I don't have a good outlet for rich, pure forms of
expression. I used to beat myself up about this - "you are not creative", "you never make anything of value", "you
don't have any original ideas". I think these thoughts are particularly damning because I see creation as a fundamental
need.

That's partially why I've started this blog. For a long time I've been frustrated because I consume more than I create.
Starting v2 of this website, with a blog, is a stepping stone towards changing this.

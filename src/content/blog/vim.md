title: "Vim with future LLMs?"

I love vim. I learned it in university when I saw some other students blazing
around with it. That combined with my laptop's trackpad breaking seeded my
journey.

Over time I've switched between using (neo)vim as my primary editor, writing /
porting some vim plugins, designed a comfy config, and learned the power of `g
<C-a>`. I've read Practical Vim, been on Vim slack channels, gone down the
YouTube rabbit hole.

I love racing around, `ciw`, `dt"`, `ca{`. I love not having to think about
things, and being able to edit at the speed of thought.

But with the advent of seriously powerful LLMs for coding (I'm looking at you
Opus 4.6, Gemini Pro 3.1) I don't really need to edit code anymore; my work has
shifted towards being prompt-driven.

It's really sad, but I'm not sure how useful learning vim is anymore. "Wait
until you ssh into a linux machine and need to manually edit code". Happens once
in a blue moon, not worth it. "You can edit your markdown files". Yeah, that's
true. But maybe speech-to-text will replace large chunks of manual writing? "For
those times when you do need to edit code it will be wonderful". True.

Would I recommend someone learn it right now? I'm really not confident. If you
want to learn something new for the pleasure of that experience, by all means.
But in terms of usefulness? Up until now I would've whole-heartedly endorsed it.
Right now I don't think I can.

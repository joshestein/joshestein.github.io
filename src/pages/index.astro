            I'm interested in AI, technical AI safety, biomedical computing, MRI, computer programming, teaching and
            magic. I'm a curious and driven person who enjoys being immersed in difficult problems. When I'm not working
            or teaching I enjoy reading, surfing, hiking and swimming. I consider myself empathetic and a good listener.
